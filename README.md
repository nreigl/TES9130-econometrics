## Private R code for the TES9130- econometrics course

The aim of this repository is to provide R code translated from the course's STATA code for training and reproducibility purposes. I extend certain functions when I see it fit, mainly for visualization and explanatory reasons.
I cannot accept any guarantee of completeness, correctness or accuracy.
